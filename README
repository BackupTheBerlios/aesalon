This is the README for aesalon, version 0.0.1 (pre-release)

---- OVERVIEW
    In a nutshell, Aesalon is a program to graphically display the dynamically-
allocated memory that another program has allocated. This can be utilized in a
number of different ways.

---- BUILDING
To build the aesalon executable, you will need the following:
- g++ (only tested with 4.3 and 4.4; but any recent g++ should work. Aesalon is
    99% ISO-c++0x compatible; there may be a few things that are not.)
- libpthread, or some other pthread implementation (NOTE: LinuxThreads will
    *not* work)
- CMake (at least version 2.6)
- bisonc++ (tested with 2.4.8, but older versions should also work)

For the aesalon GUI, you will additionally need:
- qt devel libraries (tested with Qt 4.5.2, but Qt 4.3 or greater should work)
- qt devel programs (moc4, etc. Note that qmake is *not* required)

Building aesalon is simplicity itself. (Well, maybe.) Depending on your
version of g++, there may be some hand modifications required. Assuming you've
accquired the source from somewhere, simply run these commands:

For both aesalon and aesalon_gui:
user@host[aesalon]$ cmake .
user@host[aesalon]$ make

For only aesalon:
user@host[aesalon]$ cmake .
user@host[aesalon]$ make aesalon

For only aesalon_gui:
user@host[aesalon]$ cmake .
user@host[aesalon]$ make aesalon_gui

If there are any configuration errors, correct them. (You may need to install
additional development libraries.)

The two symlinks in the root of the source directory (aesalon and aesalon_gui)
should now be valid, and pointing to executables. Simply run the symlinks to
run each program. If you so desire, you may copy the executables to a path;
neither requires any data files beyond standard Qt files.

And that is it, ladies and gentlemen -- aesalon is compiled.
