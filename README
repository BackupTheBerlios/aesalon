This is the README for Aesalon.

Aesalon is a program to monitor the dynamically-allocated memory of another
program. It uses ptrace and some trickery with DWARF debugging information to
form a reference counter that is then used to display statistics on the memory
allocated.

-- What is required to run aesalon
In order to run the aesalon monitor on a program, it simply must have been
compiled with debugging information, in the DWARF format. Beyond that, nothing
else is required.

Currently, the only implemented graphical display utilizes Qt4. However,
aesalon communicates information from the monitor to the display with TCP
network sockets; therefore it is entirely possible to monitor a program
remotely.

-- What is required to compile aesalon
Aesalon is written in c++0x-compatible C++, and is mostly POSIX-compliant; it
uses very few features that are not specified in the POSIX.1-2001. Some parts
of the program use GNU extensions and Linux-specific code (especially ptrace-
specific). Therefore, g++ and libstdc++ should be sufficient. Beyond that,
aesalon additionally requires a pthreads implementation to be installed. It is
rare, however, for a standard Linux distribution to not have the required
packages. Simply install g++ (only tested with version 4.4, but others should
work), and cmake, the buildsystem generator (tested with 2.6 and 2.8).

-- How to compile aesalon
First, edit the build.config file to change what is built, and what is not
built. The only thing that most users will need to change is the PLATFORM
variable. Currently, only x86_64 is actually supported (with x86 support
partially implemented), though ports to other platforms are certainly welcome.

Run 'cmake .' in the project root directory once you are done. This will
generate the Makefiles required to actually build aesalon. Once that is done,
run 'make', and that should be all that is required. The two symlinks in the
project root directory (aesalon and aesalon_gui) should get you started.

Good luck, and happy hacking!
