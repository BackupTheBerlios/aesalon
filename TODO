Monitor:
- Fix Breakpoint's method of storing observers to be more efficient
- Implement proper taint-tracking so references can be calculated
- Record location a block is allocated?
- Figure out why select() in ServerSocket::accept_connections mistakenly detects a connection
GUI:
- Embed Konsole inside ActiveSession?
- Add "temporary sessions", e.g. sessions that aren't saved
- Find a way to store the snapshot intervals -- perhaps in DataSource?
- Store the maximum tree depth inside the DataSource
