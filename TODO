Monitor:
- Figure out why select() in ServerSocket::accept_connections mistakenly detects a connection
- Add support for executing shell scripts
- Add support for executing 32-bit programs on 64-bit platforms (generate 32-bit overload)
- Investigate why the monitor terminates when the TCP connection is lost
- Convert push_word() to use byte sizes rather than bit sizes
- Implement support for relative pathnames (e.g. eliminate ../ from path)
- Replace the ugly linear-time scope lookup in ScopeManager::push_scope(Block *, Word).
- Find why the even uglier hack in DensityRenderer::visit(FreeEvent *) is required . . .
GUI:
- Embed Konsole inside Session for LaunchSources?
- Add "temporary sessions", e.g. sessions that aren't saved
- Find a way to store the snapshot intervals -- perhaps in DataSource?
- Store the maximum tree depth inside the DataSource
- Add other DataSources (LaunchSource, etc.)
- Generic polishing
- Partial painting in Viewport::paintEvent()
- Fix the off-by-one errors in the Viewport painting
- Add proper support for realloc'd blocks (e.g. show link to "next" block)
