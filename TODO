Monitor:
- Implement proper taint-tracking so references can be calculated
- Figure out why select() in ServerSocket::accept_connections mistakenly detects a connection
- Implement 32-bit support
- Add support for executing shell scripts
- Add support for executing 32-bit programs on 64-bit platforms (generate 32-bit overload)
- Investigate why the monitor terminates when the TCP connection is lost
GUI:
- Embed Konsole inside Session for LaunchSources?
- Add "temporary sessions", e.g. sessions that aren't saved
- Find a way to store the snapshot intervals -- perhaps in DataSource?
- Store the maximum tree depth inside the DataSource
- Add the ability to create new DataSources
- Add other DataSources (LaunchSource, etc.)
- Generic polishing
- Partial painting in Viewport::paintEvent()
