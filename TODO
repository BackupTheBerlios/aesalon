- Implement demangling in the symbol resolution code
- Convert push_word() to use byte sizes rather than bit sizes
- Implement support for relative pathnames (e.g. eliminate ../ from path)
GUI:
- Embed Konsole inside Session for LaunchSources?
- Add "temporary sessions", e.g. sessions that aren't saved
- Find a way to store the snapshot intervals -- perhaps in DataSource?
- Store the maximum tree depth inside the DataSource
- Add other DataSources (LaunchSource, etc.)
- Generic polishing
