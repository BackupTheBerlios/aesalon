The source code for the monitor is split into several directories. A list of
these directories and their respective functions is provided. Note that the
namespace name is identical to the name of the directory. (No namespace is
used for the root directory.)

.:
    Generic source files, those not specific to any one port of the program
monitor.

./analyzer:
    Libraries to parse executable files, to produce useful information such as
symbol addresses.

./event:
    Serialization and event queuing libraries.
./exception:
    Exception header files.
./misc:
    Generic source files not specific to an implementation of Aesalon, such as
a Singleton class, etc.
./overload:
    Platform-specific source files for the overload library implementation of
the monitor.
./ptrace:
    Interface to ptrace, the POSIX trace library. In essence, this contains
anything pertaining to a running process.
./tcp:
    TCP library, used to send the serialized events from the Event::
namespace.
./tracker:
    Tracks what each connected GUI knows about, sending information on-demand,
such as scope information.
