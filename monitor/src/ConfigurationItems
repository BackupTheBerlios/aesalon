/* Syntax: item(name, type, default-value, description).
    type can be Boolean, String, or Integer.
    Examples:
    item("help", Boolean, false, "Displays a help message.")
    item("search-path", String, "modules/",
    	"Sets the path to search for modules.")
	
	group(name, description)
	Examples:
		group("module-config", "Individual module configuration.")
	
	FIXME: all child items of groups are currently assumed to be string items.
	
	NOTE: If name is preceeded by an underscore, it is assumed to be an
		internally-used item and is not printed by the auto-generated about
		message.
		
	NOTE: this file is simply inserted into a special block of
		#defines in a source file. Yes, it is a hackish approach, but it
		does work. Be careful what you insert into here . . . segfaults have
		been known to occur, and weird compliations errors also.
