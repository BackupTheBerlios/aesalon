A few notes about the SHM used for communication . . .

    The first page is entirely devoted to the header, which stores important
information about the SHM as a whole, including the size of each zone, the
global packet semaphore, and the size of the configuration data.
    Immediately following the header page are the configuration page(s), the
number of which is specified in the header. After the configuration page(s)
come the zone-usage pages, then finally the zone pages themselves.
